### Abstract

Through this project we aim to cover two aspects - Song Genre Classification and Quantitative Sentiment Analysis of Lyrics in Popular Music. We seek to present a review on how lyrics can prove its usefulness in genre classification. From this study, one may be able to understand the concept and process of sentiment analysis on the basis of lyrics. Moreover, this study aims to analyse the changes in popular music over time.

We intend to use a data science approach to examine how lyrics changed between the 1950â€™s and the more recent years, and apply quantitative analysis to measure these changes. In order to identify the possible differences, we will analyze the sentiments expressed in the songs which reflect the preferences of popular music listeners and fans every year.

Through this study, we will discover the trend of popular music and statistically significant changes in sentiments expressed through their lyrics. Further, this study will be accompanied with visual and graphical representations of the analysis at every step for greater understanding of the trends of popular music.
